You can find instructions on how to start and use this app in the root README.

Once we start to build out `djangorestframework_mcp` features and leverage them here in this app, this README will contain a list of features and how to test them.

Example:

- Cursor-based Pagingation has been implemented on the list blog post endpoint (/posts) so use the list_posts tool to test pagination.
